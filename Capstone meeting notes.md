# Bubblescan Capstone Meeting Summary and Project Objectives
**<u>Participants</u>:**
* **Client**: *Dr. Brian Woods*
* **Tech Lead**: *Raju Karmuri*
* **C.S. Capstone Team**:  *Ahmet Ali Yildiz, Myles Correa, Nischita Nannapaneni*
* **A.I. Capstone Team**: *Ruthvik, Janardhan Karravula*

**<u>Objective:</u>**  
Our team arranged a meeting with the client, Dr. Woods, to gather feedback on the progress of our project and gain clarity on its future functionality. Prior to the meeting, we prepared a set of questions to ensure that we were aligning our product with Dr. Woods' requirements, addressing any outstanding issues, and avoiding any major oversights. Additionally, we used this opportunity for both capstone teams to synchronize and ensure everyone is aligned on the project's direction.

**<u>Summary:</u>** 
During the meeting, Dr. Woods provided us with two crucial documents: a PDF example of a Scantron sheet and an Excel file containing digitized data from the Scantron sheet. These resources proved invaluable in enhancing our understanding of the data we are handling, as they presented the information in a clear and accessible format. Dr. Woods elaborated on his current process for processing Scantrons and identified areas where efficiency could be improved. He emphasized the scarcity of Scantron processing machines on campus, underscoring the necessity for an external processing solution like Bubblescan.

## Discussion Points

1. **Scope of Project:** The scope of the project involves developing a software solution to optimize the processing of Scantron sheets, addressing inefficiencies in Dr. Woods’ current routine. This includes automating the data extraction process from the Scantron sheets provided by the user, processing the data using tools such as machine learning, and returning a result that is a more convenient version of the Scantron data.
2. **Data Provided:** Dr. Woods shared two key documents with the team: a PDF example of a Scantron sheet and an Excel file containing digitized data from the Scantron sheets. These documents provide valuable insight into the structure and format of the data that the team will be working with, facilitating a better understanding of the project requirements.
3. **Client Requirements:** During the meeting, Dr. Woods emphasized the need for a software solution that can streamline the processing of Scantron sheets and improve overall efficiency. He highlighted the limited availability of Scantron processing machines on campus and expressed the
importance of an external processing software like Bubblescan to address
this limitation. The client expects the software to be user-friendly, accurate, and capable of handling large volumes of data effectively.
4. **Capstone Team Recommendations:** Based on the discussion with Dr. Woods and the analysis of the provided documents, the AI Capstone Team recommends focusing on the following key areas.
	+ Developing robust data extraction algorithms to accurately capture and digitize information from Scantron sheets, keeping as much information as possible.
	+ Implementing features for batch processing and automation to
improve overall efficiency and reduce processing time, while using a visual indicator as needed while the result loads.
	+ Integrating Bubblescan or similar external processing software to complement the functionality of the developed solution and address the limited availability of Scantron processing machines on campus.
5. **Next Steps:** 
	+ Conducting a detailed analysis of the provided Scantron data to
identify patterns and potential challenges.
	+ Furthering development of the software solution, prioritizing features that align with the client’s requirements and project objectives.
	+ Scheduling regular check-ins with the client to provide updates on the project progress and gather feedback for iterative improvements.
	+ Improving the “look” of the software to improve the user’s
experience.

**Scanned PDFs and expected output files** are given in the Input Data folder.
